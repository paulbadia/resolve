[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/reimagined/resolve.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/reimagined/resolve) [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/create-resolve-app.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/create-resolve-app) [![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reimagined/resolve/master/LICENSE)

A JavaScript framework for **CQRS**, **Domain-Driven Design** and **Event Sourcing** with good support for **React** and **Redux**. reSolve provides a new way to describe app's core logic and fully separate it from the auxiliary code.

## <a name="why-resolve">**🏗️ Why reSolve**</a>

With reSolve you can create applications of any complexity level more efficiently. A single approach is used for a simple [ToDo List](#todo-list) and for a complicated reactive application like [Hacker News](https://github.com/reimagined/hacker-news-resolve) with distributed serverless architecture ready for high load. The technologies stack (CQRS, Event Sourcing, Domain-Driven Design, React + Redux) makes any reSolve application scalable and maintainable, so you can focus on a business logic instead of an auxiliary code.

## <a name="getting-started">**🚀 Getting Started**</a>

### <a name="installation">Installation</a>

We have a special package [create-resolve-app](packages/create-resolve-app) for creation of any reSolve based application. It can be one of the our examples, or any your application. By default `create-resolve-app` creates empty [Hello world](https://github.com/reimagined/resolve/tree/master/examples/hello-world) application. You can start working with new reSolve application just in **2 minutes**.

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/reimagined/resolve/blob/feature/new_readme/readme-installation.gif"></p>

The created application is hosted at http://localhost:3000/ and http://<your_ip>:3000/ (you can [change your url settings](https://github.com/reimagined/resolve/blob/master/docs/API%20References.md)). We recommend you [**First Application From Scratch**](https://github.com/reimagined/resolve/blob/master/docs/Tutorials/First%20Application%20From%20Scratch.md) tutorial to learn more about application structure and work with reSolve. Also it'd be helpfull: [**documentation**](#documentation), [**tutorials**](#tutorials) and [**examples**](#examples).

#### Using npx

> Note: Don't forget about [npx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx) installation.
```bash
npx create-resolve-app hello-world-app
cd hello-world-app
npm run dev
```

#### Using yarn

> Note: Don't forget about [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) installation
```bash
yarn create resolve-app hello-world-app
cd hello-world-app
yarn run dev
```

#### Using npm
> Note: Installing a package globally may require administrative privileges. That means you have to use the sudo command for Unix-based systems or run a terminal with administrative privileges on Windows systems.

```bash
npm i -g create-resolve-app
create-resolve-app hello-world-app
cd hello-world-app
npm run dev
```

### <a name="examples">Examples</a>

Example setup is similar with new application creation, but it has `--example` or `-e` flag with example name. You can start working with reSolve example just in **2 minutes**.

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/reimagined/resolve/blob/feature/new_readme/readme-example-installation.gif"></p>

The created example is hosted at http://localhost:3000/ and http://<your_ip>:3000/ (you can [change your url settings](https://github.com/reimagined/resolve/blob/master/docs/API%20References.md)). Also you can look at [**tutorials**](#tutorials) for some examples.

#### Using npx
```bash
npx create-resolve-app todo-example -e todo
```

#### Using yarn
```bash
yarn create resolve-app todo-example -e todo
```

#### Using npm
```bash
create-resolve-app todo-example -e todo
```

* [**hello-world**](https://github.com/reimagined/resolve/tree/master/examples/hello-world)

It's a simple empty example that can be used like **reSolve application boilerplate**.

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/reimagined/resolve/blob/feature/new_readme/readme-hello-world-example.png"></p>

* [**top-list**](https://github.com/reimagined/resolve/tree/master/examples/top-list)

This example demonstrates **reactive read-models** that leads to client updating without page reloads. You can learn more about [read-models in documentation](https://github.com/reimagined/resolve/blob/master/docs/Read%20Model.md)

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/reimagined/resolve/blob/feature/new_readme/readme-top-list-example.png"></p>

* [**todo**](https://github.com/reimagined/resolve/tree/master/examples/todo)

This example demonstrates **simple work with view-models**. You can learn more in [ToDo List App Tutorial](https://github.com/reimagined/resolve/blob/master/docs/Tutorials/ToDo%20List%20App%20Tutorial.md) and [documentation](https://github.com/reimagined/resolve/blob/master/docs/View%20Model.md).

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/reimagined/resolve/blob/feature/new_readme/readme-todo-example.png"></p>

* [**todo-two-levels**](https://github.com/reimagined/resolve/tree/master/examples/todo-two-levels)

This example demonstrates work with view-models in case of **all events subscribtion**. Sometimes, for example for fast application prototyping, it's necessary to have view-model on client with all server events instead of part. There's a special feature called **wildcard**, that allows to subscribe to all events, you can learn more about that in [documentation](https://github.com/reimagined/resolve/blob/master/docs/View%20Model.md).

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/reimagined/resolve/blob/feature/new_readme/readme-todo-two-levels-example.png"></p>

## <a name="documentation">**📚 Documentation**</a>

### <a name="compatibility">Compatibility</a>

You can comfortably run and develop reSolve application for **Linux**, **Mac** and **Windows** operation systems using **bash** and **cmd** terminals. Also you can develop using **React Native**, but currently it's **experimental** approach.

You can use any package manager, but we recommend you to look at [**npx**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx) and [**yarn**](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) apart from **npm**. We use exactly npx manager in our tutorials like a default way.

Minimum supported **NodeJS** version is **6.0.0**.
